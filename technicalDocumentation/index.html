                    Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike
                    other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The
                    core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other
                    libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering
                    sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting
                    libraries.

                    If you'd like to learn more about Vue before diving in, we created a video walking through the core
                    principles and a sample project.

                    The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the Hello World example. Feel free to open it in another
                    tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. Or, you can create an index.html file and
                    include Vue with:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &lt;!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings --&gt;
                    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                </code>
                <p>
                    The Installation page provides more options of installing Vue. Note: We do not recommend that
                    beginners start with vue-cli, especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.
                </p>

                    If you prefer something more interactive, you can also check out this tutorial series on Scrimba,
                    which gives you a mix of screencast and code playground that you can pause and play around with
                    anytime.

                    At the core of Vue.js is a system that enables us to declaratively render data to the DOM using
                    straightforward template syntax:
                    <code>
                        &lt;div id="app"&gt;
                            {{ message }}
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                    </code>
                    <code>
                        var app = new Vue({
                            el: '#app',
                            data: {
                              message: 'Hello Vue!'
                            }
                          })
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty similar to rendering a string
                    template, but Vue has done a lot of work under the hood. The data and the DOM are now linked, and
                    everything is now reactive. How do we know? Open your browser's JavaScript console (right now, on
                    this page) and set app.message to a different value. You should see the rendered example above
                    update accordingly.

                    It's easy to toggle the presence of an element, too:
                </p>
                <code>
                    &lt;div id="app-3"&gt;
                    &lt;span v-if="seen"&gt;Now you see me&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                </code>
                <code>
                    var app3 = new Vue({
                        el: '#app-3',
                        data: {
                          seen: true
                        }
                      })
                </code>
                <p>
                    This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text and attributes, but also the
                    structure of the DOM. Moreover, Vue also provides a powerful transition effect system that can
                    automatically apply transition effects when elements are inserted/updated/removed by Vue.

                <p>
                    You may have noticed that Vue components are very similar to Custom Elements, which are part of the
                    Web Components Spec. That's because Vue's component syntax is loosely modeled after the spec. For
                    example, Vue components implement the Slot API and the is special attribute. However, there are a
                    few key differences:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The Web Components Spec has been finalized, but is not natively implemented in every browser.
                        Safari 10.1+, Chrome 54+ and Firefox 63+ natively support web components. In comparison, Vue
                        components don't require any polyfills and work consistently in all supported browsers (IE9 and
                        above). When needed, Vue components can also be wrapped inside a native custom element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vue components provide important features that are not available in plain custom elements, most
                        notably cross-component data flow, custom event communication and build tool integrations.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Although Vue doesn't use custom elements internally, it has great interoperability when it comes to
                    consuming or distributing as custom elements. Vue CLI also supports building Vue components that
                    register themselves as native custom elements.
                </p>

                    Vue wraps an observed array's mutation methods so they will also trigger view updates. The wrapped
                    methods are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>push()</li>
                    <li>pop()</li>
                    <li>shift()</li>
                    <li>unshift()</li>
                    <li>splice()</li>
                    <li>sort()</li>
                    <li>reverse()</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can open the console and play with the previous examples'<code>items</code> array by calling
                    their mutation
                    methods. For example: <code>example1.items.push({ message: 'Baz' })</code>.
